<h2>How to use MMSd</h2>
<p>MMSd is a REST-service. It requires not authentication and no client registration, so to use it you can just go over to the <a href="/docs/apiref">api reference</a>.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>For major changes to the api, we will add a new version number to the url, e.g /api/v2/events.
    For smaller changes to the api, we will provide a beta service which includes those changes, before merging the changes into the production version.
</p>
<p>
    For all significant changes, we will send out a description of the change on the <a href="mailto:mmsd-users@met.no>">mailinglist</a>.
    We will also update the <a href="/docs/changelog">changelog</a>.
</p>

<h3>Error handling</h3>
<p>
    We use regular 4xx and 5xx http status codes, as close as possible to the HTTP specification. Some errors will have a message of what went wrong in it. 
    Some errors will respons with json. Do not encode those json error responses, as they might change without proper versioning as described above.
</p>
<p>
    There might be cases where the service can give a successfull response, but the response object is missing some data.
    In that case, we will include one or more warning messages in the object.
